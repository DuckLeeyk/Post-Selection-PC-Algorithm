# Post-Selection-PC-Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the post-selection inference method for causal effects after causal discovery as proposed by Chang T H, Guo Z, Malinsky D. in their paper *Post-selection inference for causal effects after causal discovery* [arXiv:2405.06763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06763), 2024.

## Overview

The method provided in this repository aims to reproduce the model and approach proposed in the aforementioned paper using Python.
